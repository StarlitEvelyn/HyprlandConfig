# HyprlandConfig

Config files belong in: `~/.config/hypr/`
Wallpaper belogs in `~/.wallpaper.jpg`

### Dependencies

This is not tested for anything but ArchLinux, I do not promise for it to work completely out of the box fully no matter what.

If anyone wishes to use my config feel free to use it
